```

## Client Layer
- **Mobile:** React Native with native modules for AR (ARKit/ARCore), push notifications, and local caching (Realm/WatermelonDB).
- **Web:** Next.js PWA with offline caching (Workbox), responsive component library (Chakra UI + custom Helldiver theme).
- **Shared:** Monorepo with TypeScript, GraphQL code generation, and Storybook for component validation.

## API Gateway
- GraphQL federation to unify microservices.
- DataLoader caching, persisted queries, and schema-driven analytics.
- Authentication via Auth0 + game account linking (OAuth + JWT + device attestation).

## Services
### Live Ops Hub
- Rust + Actix Web for high-throughput real-time war updates.
- WebSocket + SSE endpoints, with region-aware edge deployment (Fastly/Cloudflare Workers).
- Uses Redis streams for transient event distribution.

### Player Services
- NestJS microservices for squads, inventory, notifications, and social graph.
- CQRS pattern with TypeORM (write) and ElasticSearch (read) for loadout search.
- Scheduled tasks (BullMQ) for rotation refresh, mission forecasting.

### Data Services
- Postgres for relational data (users, squads, loadouts).
- Redis for caching, rate limiting, feature flags.
- S3-compatible object storage for media (AWS S3 or Backblaze B2).
- Managed vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) for AI assistant embeddings.

## Integrations
- **Game Telemetry API:** Poll + webhook ingestion to sync war status and player stats.
- **Community Content:** Curated sources (Reddit, Discord) via moderation pipeline and manual approval.
- **Payment Providers:** Stripe for premium subscriptions, managed via PCI-compliant checkout.

## Security & Compliance
- Role-based access control for admin tools, with policy-as-code (OPA).
- Regional data residency compliance (GDPR, CCPA) with sharding strategies.
- Runtime protections: WAF, bot detection, and rate limiting.
- Secrets management via Vault, automated rotation.

## Observability
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation across services.
- Metrics -> Prometheus + Grafana, Logs -> Loki, Traces -> Jaeger.
- Synthetic monitoring for critical user flows (mission planner, notifications).

## DevOps Pipeline
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with monorepo orchestrations (Nx/Turborepo).
- Automated tests: unit, contract (GraphQL), integration (Testcontainers), E2E (Detox, Playwright).
- Canary deployments with feature flags (LaunchDarkly/OpenFeature).
- Infrastructure as Code via Terraform + Helm charts on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/Azure AKS).

## Offline & Resilience Strategies
- Background sync jobs to refresh mission intel, stored for offline usage.
- Client-side fallback caches for last known war status with version stamping.
- Graceful degradation: text-based briefs when 3D assets fail to load.
- Kill switches for problematic features.
