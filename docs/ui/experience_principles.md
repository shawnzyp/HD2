# UX & Experience Principles

## Tone & Personality
- **Super Earth Official:** Channel propaganda-chic language with heroic flair, while respecting clarity.
- **High-Fidelity Visuals:** Utilize holographic layers, dynamic lighting, and responsive particle accents without sacrificing legibility.
- **Immersive Feedback:** Haptics, adaptive soundscapes, and micro-animations should celebrate player actions.

## Navigation Model
1. **Command Deck Tabs:** Primary tabs for Dashboard, Squad Ops, Arsenal, Intel, and Profile.
2. **Action Drawer:** Contextual slide-up drawer containing quick actions, notifications, and mission-critical alerts.
3. **Global Search:** Omnipresent search with command palette behavior, accessible via gesture or hardware shortcuts.
4. **Second Screen Toggle:** Fast access switch that reconfigures UI for live mission support with floating widgets.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Two-Tap Rule:** Core tasks complete in ≤ 2 taps from relevant entry point.
- **Adaptive Layouts:** Breakpoints for phones, tablets, and web with shared component library.
- **Squad Presence:** Persistent squad avatar stack showing online status, voice indicators, and ping actions.
- **Diegetic Animations:** Use mission briefing transitions, holographic scans, and stratagem call-ins to communicate state changes.

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance baseline.
- Dynamic text sizing, contrast modes (Standard, Night Ops, High Contrast).
- Full screen reader support with lore-friendly labels.
- Vibration and sound toggles with granular control.
- Localized content for major languages with rtl support for applicable languages.

## Key Screens
1. **War Table:** Globe + mission list, pinch to zoom, tap to open planet dossier.
2. **Squad Loadout Planner:** Card-based drag-and-drop stratagems, stat comparisons, synergy meter.
3. **Stratagem Practice:** AR overlay instructing inputs, timed challenges, leaderboard.
4. **Mission Debrief:** Animated timeline of mission events, medal distribution, highlight reel generation.

## Microcopy Guidelines
- Use propaganda slogans sparingly for delight. Example: “For Super Earth!” on success toasts.
- Provide contextual help disguised as briefings (e.g., “Directive: Equip anti-armor solutions”).
- Error states framed as bureaucratic responses (“Request denied by Command — check uplink”).

## Personalization
- Allow theme swaps (Standard Command, Night Ops, Retro Terminal, Liberation Parade).
- Widget system for dashboard customizing; reorder modules with drag handles.
- Behavior-based prompts (e.g., suggest practicing stratagems after repeated failures detected via telemetry).
